# 📋 ObjectBuilder - Changelog

## [0.7.0] - 2025-06-03 - 🚀 Drag and Drop Improvements

### 🎉 **New Features**

#### **Enhanced Multi-Frame Group Drag & Drop Support**

- **Improved Spritesheet Import**: Fixed drag & drop functionality for outfits with multiple frame groups (idle/stand + walking)
- **Automatic Layout Detection**: The system now automatically detects combined spritesheets and splits them correctly between frame groups
- **Smart Size Validation**: Enhanced validation that supports both combined layouts and individual frame group layouts
- **Fallback Support**: If combined layout doesn't match, falls back to importing into the currently selected frame group

### 🔧 **Technical Improvements**

#### **Drag & Drop System Enhancements**

- **`handleMultiFrameGroupImport()`**: New function to handle spritesheets containing both idle and walking animations
- **Layout Detection Logic**: Automatically calculates expected combined dimensions (width = max of both, height = sum of both)
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of temporary bitmaps to prevent memory leaks
- **Error Messages**: Improved error messages showing expected vs actual dimensions

#### **Frame Group Processing**

- **Automatic Splitting**: Spritesheets are automatically split into idle (top) and walking (bottom) sections
- **Independent Processing**: Each frame group is processed independently with correct sprite data
- **Type Safety**: Proper handling of FrameGroupType.DEFAULT and FrameGroupType.WALKING

### 📋 **Use Cases Now Supported**

1. **Single Frame Group Outfits**: Continue to work as before (7 animations, 2 layers → 512x448 px)
2. **Multi Frame Group Outfits**:
   - Combined Layout: e.g., 512x896 px (idle: 512x448 + walking: 512x448)
   - Individual Import: Can still import to specific frame groups individually
3. **Automatic Detection**: System intelligently chooses the right import method

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**

- Fixed drag & drop not working for outfits with idle/stand + walking frame groups
- Fixed spritesheet size validation for multi-frame group scenarios
- Fixed memory management in bitmap processing

### 💡 **Future Enhancements**

- Support for horizontal layout detection (side-by-side frame groups)
- Advanced layout pattern recognition
- Batch processing of multiple spritesheets
